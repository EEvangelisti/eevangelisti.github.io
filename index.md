The **Oomycete Molecular Genetics Network (OMGN)** brings together researchers 
working on the molecular, cellular and genetic foundations of oomycete biology.

Oomycetes are filamentous eukaryotes that include some of the most devastating 
plant pathogens affecting global food security and ecosystem resilience. Despite 
their agronomic importance, their molecular mechanisms remain comparatively 
understudied relative to fungi.

OMGN was created to foster exchange, collaboration and methodological innovation 
within the oomycete research community.

### Our objectives

- Promote advances in molecular genetics and functional genomics  
- Encourage the development and sharing of tools and resources  
- Support early-career researchers  
- Facilitate international collaboration

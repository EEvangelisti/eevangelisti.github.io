The OMGN is open to all researchers with an interest in oomycetes and from disciplines ranging from molecular genetics, genomics, biology, population biology, ecology, either at an experimental or a computational level. Investigators new to the field are always welcome, for example, those interested in saprophytes and animal pathogens. You can [join the OMGN mailing list](https://lists.oregonstate.edu/mailman/listinfo/omgn-users) maintained by Nik Grünwald.

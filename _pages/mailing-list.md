The OMGN is open to all researchers with an interest in oomycetes, from disciplines ranging from molecular genetics and genomics to biology, population biology, and ecology, at either an experimental or a computational level. Investigators new to the field are always welcome, for example, those interested in saprophytes and animal pathogens. You can [join the OMGN mailing list](https://airtable.com/app4z85HJOGeEMGUc/shrsOfTvREXfUnwoT).
